What does the program do:
Similar to any database, our program supports data adding, deleting, searching, and file processing. 

How to run the code:
Our porgram has straighfoward instructions when you run it, but you will need to have data.txt.
Following text is our menu, and the user will know what is going on while runnning since we also provide instructions/directions for every step.
